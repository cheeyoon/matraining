    <h1>We are honored to have served you</h1>
    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <p class="paragraph">It is with heavy hearts and a profound sense of gratitude that we write to share some difficult news. After much consideration and reflection, we regret to inform you that, due to the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our beloved service dog training facility must close its doors.<br><br>Over the years, our dedicated team has poured their passion and commitment into creating a haven for the training and nurturing of service dogs. We have been honored to witness the transformative impact these incredible animals have had on the lives of individuals facing various challenges, both visible and unseen. The joy of placing a trained service dog with someone in need is a feeling that words can scarcely capture.<br><br>Through the years, we have seen the profound bond that forms between our service dogs and their handlers. These four-legged companions have not only provided assistance with daily tasks but have also offered immeasurable emotional support, becoming steadfast allies in the journey toward independence. Witnessing the positive change in the lives of those we have served has been the driving force behind our mission.<br><br>Regrettably, the financial strain and uncertainties brought about by the pandemic have left us with no choice but to cease operations. This decision was not made lightly, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to every supporter, volunteer, donor, and staff member who has contributed to our mission. Your kindness has made a lasting impact on the disabled community, and we are forever thankful for the moments of hope and resilience you helped create.<br><br>While our facility may close, the spirit of service and compassion that defined us lives on in the countless lives touched by our service dogs. We encourage our community to continue supporting one another and to celebrate the resilience that our furry graduates have instilled in each of us.<br><br>Thank you for allowing us the privilege of serving this incredible community. Our hearts are full as we reflect on the memories created, and we remain inspired by the strength and courage of those who have walked alongside us.<br><br>With sincere appreciation and warm regards,<br><br><span class="header-italic">— Modern Animal Training Org</span></p>
